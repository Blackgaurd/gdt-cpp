# Genetic Decision Tree

Translated to C++ from Python.

## File structure

- `include`: header files (.hpp)
- `src`: source files (.cpp)
- `models`: models that use the header files as a library

## Makefile

To run a model, use the command:

```bash
make MODEL=MODEL_NAME
```

(I do not know how makefiles work or how object files work.)
